# Synchro_Angiogenesis_Model
A version of our Angiogenesis Model that considers the synchronized evolution of a tumor and a blood vessel network. Our implemented tools and analysis focused on understanding how network metrics are related to tumor growth and the prognosis of 2 treatments - which are 1) Radiotherapy, and 2) VDA (Vascular Disruptive Agents)
